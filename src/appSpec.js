Studying, training and teaching martial arts is a big part of my life. I
started learning <b>Chen Style Taijiquan</b> in Singapore from Sifu Chen
Hui-Qiu and Sifu Hu Su-Tan in 1993. I was then seconded to study under
Grandmaster Zhu Tian-Cai for several years even during my doctoral studies at
Duke University. I met <a href="https://iliqchuan.com/grand-master-sam-fs-chin/">Sifu Sam Chin</a> in 2004 at a park in Manhattan's Chinatown
on a Sunday and have since studied the art of <b>I Liq Chuan</b> with him.
In Honolulu, I briefly dabbled in edge and blunt weapons while studying <b>Kalis Illustrissimo</b> with Lowell Manabe from 2017 to 2018.

        <h2>I Liq Chuan &#24847;&#21147;&#25331; </h2>

        <p>
                I consider <b>I Liq Chuan</b> my primary art. As an internal martial art, I Liq Chuan's curriculum is the Ph.D. program of martial arts: not only does it cover mechanics and physical movement principles, but it dives into the cognitive processes of learning and of the interaction between you and your opponents. 
        </p>
        <p>I Liq Chuan was founded by Sigong Chin Lik Keong in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, synthesizing and distilling the various chinese martial arts traditions he had learned. The above-mentioned curriculum was the culmination of decades of teaching by Sifu Sam (Fan Siong) Chin after he emigrated to the United States. Note that the curriculum defers from those from other branches of I Liq Chuan.</p>

        <p>I have taught I Liq Chuan since 2007: in New York (2007-2009), in Honolulu (2009-2019). I have also organized I Liq Chuan workshops by Sifu Sam Chin in Honolulu between 2010 to 2015.

        <h2>Kalis Illustrissimo</h2>

        <p>
        A fortuitous meeting of Lowell Manabe and Rod Watson practising Kalis Illustrissimo at Noelani Elementary School in Honolulu, HI, led to two years of weapons training with Lowell Manabe. Lowell Manabe studied under various Balintawak teachers and the Kalis Illustrissimo group under Tony Diego in the Philippines. The beauty of the escrima framework is the distillation of all blunt-and-edge, long-and-short weapons into a set of unifying principles.

        <h2>Chen Style Taijiquan</h2>

        <p>
        I started learning Chen style Taijiquan at a class in Yishun, Singapore in circa 1993. I am grateful to my teachers Chen Hui-Qiu and Hu Su-Tan for cultivating my interest and for their meticulous instruction in the nuances of Chen style Taijiquan.A few years later, my primary teachers recommended that I study under GM Zhu Tian-Cai, one of the four tigers or buddha warriors of Chen village Taijiquan. 
        </p>
        <p> 
        I have taught Taijiquan as a teaching assistant in Singapore from 1995 to 1999. During my graduate studies at Duke University between 1999 and 2004, I started a Taijiquan Club, taught Chen Style Taijiquan, and organized several workshops for GM Zhu Tian-Cai.
